# The Relationship of Transit Deserts and Inequality: A Case Study of Travis County Using Simple Linear Regression Analysis
Brian Folkers, Lucas Herrera, Dylan Riordan, Emilio Chona


## Overview
This project will attempt to examine the relationship between adequate public transportation and economic inequality measured by poverty, unemployment, and minority status.


## Description
The term 'transit desert' refers to an area that has a higher demand for public transit than is actually provided. Similarly, a 'transit oasis' is an area with more public transit than required. Using the large amount of data available on public transit supply and demand, this project will examine how the characteristic of an area's public transit relates to its economic inequality. By using data on transit score as the response variable and poverty, unemployment, minority status as the explanatory variables, this project focuses on simple linear regression models that examine the correlation between public transportation and indicators of economic inequality.
